# Predictive-Analytics-for-Breast-Cancer
This project focuses on developing a predictive model to support early detection and diagnosis of breast cancer using machine learning techniques. Leveraging a publicly available dataset, such as the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset, the analysis identifies patterns and key features associated with malignant and benign tumors.

Key project goals include:

- Data Preparation and Exploration: Cleaning and analyzing the dataset to identify relevant variables that influence predictions.

- Feature Engineering: Selecting and optimizing features that enhance the accuracy of the model.

- Model Development: Implementing machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, or random forests to predict tumor classification.

- Model Evaluation: Validating model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

- Insights and Recommendations: Presenting findings in a clear and actionable manner, emphasizing the importance of predictive analytics in supporting clinical decision-making and improving patient outcomes.

This project demonstrates the application of data analytics in healthcare, showcasing technical skills in data processing, statistical analysis, and machine learning, while emphasizing the potential for impactful solutions in medical diagnostics.
